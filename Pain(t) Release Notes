1.1.5
-----------------------------
Aidan's Pain(t) Version 1.1.5 -  10/04/2024
New features:
allow you to rotate (90/180/270) an image, as well as mirror [as in, do a horizontal and vertical flip (so, left becomes right / top becomes bottom).]
allow the rotate of either a selection (a chunk) or for your whole canvas.  [that is a both of those]
have icons for drawing tools; preferred is all buttons, etc.  (you may retain existing text labels if you want or add if you have icons already).
notifications (as in in the corner of window, from the OS); for autosave - trigger or on off.
have tool tips for your buttons that appear on hover.
control keys (cntrl s for save, etc.)
star with variable number of points (4 aka diamond ... on up)
Also: Threading is now expected.  Specifically, you need to have threaded logging.  For logging, you're "tracking" what the user does:
Known issues:
  * Many of the features are implemented, but unable to get rotate working fully, notifications are not functioning properly, and logging was not accessible in the current form.
Expected for final design:
Full Functionality and user experience better, getting all of the features from past sprints implemented, as well as splitting up the code to fix it more efficiently

1.1.3
-----------------------------
Aidan's Pain(t) Version 1.1.3 -  09/20/2024
New features:
* Undo and Redo
* provide a blank starting image and a clear canvas (with "are you sure" check) tool
* additional shape
* regular side polygon with any #of sides
* select and copy/paste a piece of the image  
* select and move a piece of the image
* allow the addition of text from user-typed input to your image
* tabs

Known issues:
  * Tabs work somewhat with one canvas, but don’t allow for another. The move tool is setup but doesn’t allow for selection. The text tool prompts the user for an input but doesn’t display anything currently. Clear canvas doesn’t work fully anymore.
Expected next sprint:
The software shall have at least 3 unit tests.
The software shall have a timer that allows for autosave.  (threading not required but probably a good idea)
The timer's countdown shall be optionally (as in some way to choose on/off) visible to the user.  Bonus/optional: Reset the timer on a user's save.
The software shall incorporate a webserver to presents one or more of the images (in tabs), as selected by the user.  If no images are selected, an appropriate message will be displayed or the functionality will be offline.
The code shall have some JavaDoc commenting.
The software shall have the ability to save in an alternative file format than the one that was the original for the image.
The software shall have a warning image features/data loss can happen
Tip:think about how you prove this! A demonstration/test plan/note on how should be included in your deliverable.
